# Fine-ants (Feynman's Ants)

## Idea
I get the idea from a book called **"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!",** where
Richard Feynman described, how he had studied the behavior of ants.

## Implementation
This is a very basic implementation, which I wrote when I was learning canvas.
So there is not "real AI", there are a few bugs (not including the ants) and
the code is not very nice.
In the future I will make it slightly better (I hope).
